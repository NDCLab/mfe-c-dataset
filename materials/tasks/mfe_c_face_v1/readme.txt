There is a MATLAB script that can generate 13 CSV files for the trials of the face Flanker task.
404 faces are randomly selected from the faces loacted in the img/renders folder. After that it randomly create 13 CSV files.
Please read the notes of that script to fully understand how it works. It is stored in the img folder and called "trial_csv_creator.m"!


# NOTE ON DISPLAY SETTINGS: 
# This task uses PsychoPy's default testMonitor profile, which does not match the physical monitor's profile used in the study. 
# All visual elements were manually measured on the display monitor to 
# ensure their intended real-world size.

# WARNING: If you change the monitor profile to the correct specifications, 
# the sizes of all stimuli will be significantly altered and will not match 
# the original experiment. To replicate this study accurately, you must use 
# the same monitor model while keeping the default testMonitor setting. 
# Refer to the accompanying paper for hardware details.
