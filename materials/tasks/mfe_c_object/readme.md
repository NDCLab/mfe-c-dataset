# NOTE ON DISPLAY SETTINGS: 
# This task uses PsychoPy's default testMonitor profile, which does not match the physical monitor's profile used in the study. 
# All visual elements were manually measured on the display monitor to 
# ensure their intended real-world size.

# WARNING: If you change the monitor profile to the correct specifications, 
# the sizes of all stimuli will be significantly altered and will not match 
# the original experiment. To replicate this study accurately, you must use 
# the same monitor model while keeping the default testMonitor setting. 
# Refer to the accompanying paper for hardware details.
